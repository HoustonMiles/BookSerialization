# BookSerialization
This Java project explores object serialization, deserialization, and core language features using a custom Book class. Itâ€™s designed as a learning sandbox for working with object-oriented design, file I/O, and testing frameworks.

Key components include:

 - Book Object Modeling: A class with attributes like title, author, ISBN, and genre

 - Driver Class: Instantiates and manages multiple book objects

 - CSV Serialization: Static methods that serialize book data to CSV and deserialize it back into objects using java.nio for modern file handling

 - Equality Logic: Overridden equals() method for meaningful object comparison

 - JUnit Testing: Unit tests to validate serialization, deserialization, and equality behavior
